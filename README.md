ANU Course project @COMP1130

Enjoying a worldwide popularity, Sudoku never fails to appeal to programmers.
This repository implements some human-like algorithms to solve Sudoku in Haskell.

## => read <https://github.com/ShiqinHuo/Sudoku_Solver_in_Haskell/blob/master/Report.pdf> for more details

Algorithm:

Solving Algorithm 1: Depth-first Search (Brute Force/Backtracking) (Tony’s Skeleton Solution)

Solving Algorithm 2: Prioritize the Guessing Order (Extension 1)

Solving Algorithm 3: Constraint Propagation (Extension 2) 
 
•	Hidden Singles (Solver level 1 in code) 
  
•	Prune Naked Pairs (Solver level 2 in code) 
 
•	Prune Naked Triples (Solver level 3 in code)

Generating Algorithm: Las Vegas Algorithm (Extension 3)

For a full explanation, read Report.pdf which explains the algorithms & implementation in details 
and give a personal analysis.
